### Steps to Add Images:

1. Place your images (`home_screen.png` and `create_project_screen.png`) in an `assets` folder within your project directory (e.g., `src/assets/`).
2. Update the image paths in the `README.md` file based on the actual location of the files (e.g., `./src/assets/home_screen.png`).

This will display the images in the `README.md` file when viewed on GitHub or other markdown-supported platforms. Let me know if you need help setting up the assets folder!
